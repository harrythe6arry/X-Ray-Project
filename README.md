This X-ray project is about color differentiation and testing algorithm for differentiating Covid patients from healthy and non healthy lung. It utilizes calculating texture features using GLCM, edge operators such as Sobel operator and other color grading features. Then the program analyze and output a visulization of healthy and non healthy lungs from the dataset.
